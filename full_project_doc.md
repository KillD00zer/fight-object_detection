# Documentation: `full_project.py`

## Overview

This script serves as the main entry point for a video analysis pipeline that combines fight detection and object detection. It prompts the user for a video file path and then sequentially runs two separate analysis modules:

1.  **Fight Detection:** Uses the `fight_detec` function (imported from `Fight_detec_func.py`) to classify the video as containing "FIGHT" or "NORMAL" activity.
2.  **Object Detection:** Uses the `detection` function (imported from `objec_detect_yolo.py`) to identify specific objects (like 'Gun', 'Knife', 'Fire', etc.) within the video using a YOLO model.

The script is designed to be simple to run, taking a single video path as input and executing both analysis tasks on it.

## Functionality

1.  **Import Modules:** Imports necessary functions (`fight_detec`, `detection`) from the corresponding custom Python files (`Fight_detec_func.py`, `objec_detect_yolo.py`). It also imports several standard libraries (like `cv2`, `numpy`, `os`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `ultralytics`), although many of these are likely used *within* the imported functions rather than directly in this script.
2.  **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter the local path to the video file they want to analyze using the `input()` function.
3.  **Path Cleaning:** Removes any leading/trailing double quotation marks (`"`) from the input path using `.strip('"')`. This is helpful because copying file paths from Windows File Explorer sometimes includes quotes.
4.  **Information Message:** Prints a message confirming the video path that is being loaded.
5.  **Execute Fight Detection:** Calls the `fight_detec(path)` function. This function will perform its analysis (loading model, extracting frames, predicting) and typically print its results (e.g., "FIGHT (Confidence: X%)" or "NORMAL (Confidence: Y%)") and potentially save debug visualizations to the console/disk, as defined within `Fight_detec_func.py`.
6.  **Execute Object Detection:** Calls the `detection(path)` function. This function will perform its analysis (loading YOLO model, processing frames, detecting/tracking objects) and typically print the detected object classes and save an annotated output video, as defined within `objec_detect_yolo.py`.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure all dependency libraries are installed (see Dependencies section below).
2.  Make sure the required custom modules (`Fight_detec_func.py`, `objec_detect_yolo.py`, `frame_slicer.py`) and the necessary model files (the Keras `.h5` model for fight detection and the YOLO `.pt` model for object detection) are located correctly relative to the script or accessible via the paths specified within those modules.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory containing `full_project.py`.
5.  Run the script using the Python interpreter: `python full_project.py`
6.  When prompted, enter the full path to the video file you want to analyze and press Enter.

The script will then execute the fight detection and object detection processes sequentially, printing output from each module to the console.

## Dependencies

This script relies on the successful execution of the imported modules. Therefore, it indirectly depends on all libraries required by those modules:

*   **`Fight_detec_func.py` Dependencies:**
    *   TensorFlow (`tensorflow`)
    *   OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
    *   NumPy (`numpy`)
    *   Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
    *   `frame_slicer.py` (and its dependencies: `opencv-python`, `numpy`)
*   **`objec_detect_yolo.py` Dependencies:**
    *   Ultralytics (`ultralytics`) - Includes PyTorch and other dependencies.
    *   OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
    *   NumPy (`numpy`)
    *   (Potentially others depending on the specific `ultralytics` version)

**Installation:** You would typically install these using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib ultralytics
```

## Input

*   A local file path to a video file (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi`) provided via command-line input when prompted.

## Output

*   **Console Output:** Prints informational messages, results from the fight detection module, and results from the object detection module.
*   **File Output (Generated by imported modules):**
    *   May save debug images/plots from `fight_detec` (if debug is enabled) to the path specified in `Fight_detec_func.py`.
    *   Saves an annotated output video from `detection` (showing bounding boxes and tracks) to the path specified in `objec_detect_yolo.py`. The filename typically includes the names of detected objects.
